# Elective 4: Data Analytics

This repository contains all Python coding activities. Each coding question/activity has its own associated Python file.

1.  Create a Python program that converts peso to dollar. ([`PesoToDollarConverter.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/PesoToDollarConverter.py))

2.  Create a Python program that gets the sum of two inputted numbers. ([`SumOfTwoNumbers.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/SumOfTwoNumbers.py))

3.  You have 30 pieces of candy and you want to share them equally with 5 friends. How many pieces of candy does each friend get? ([`TotalCandyPerFriends.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/TotalCandyPerFriends.py))

4.  You are painting a room that is 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. How many square feet of paint do you need if one gallon of paint covers 350 square feet? ([`GallonsOfPaint.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/GallonsOfPaint.py))

5.  Create a Python program that accepts two strings, then displays its total characters when combined. ([`TotalCharacterOfCombinedStrings.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/TotalCharacterOfCombinedStrings.py))

6.  You are tasked to change all ".net" instances of an email to ".com". Start with this email: internet1@gmail.net ([`TopLevelDomainConverter.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/TopLevelDomainConverter.py))

7.  Create a Python program that will accept the number of apples, oranges, and lemons (has to be an integer). Use string formatting to display this sentence: "I have n apples, n orangles, and n lemons." ([`FruitStringFormatting.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/FruitStringFormatting.py))

8.  Create a Python program that checks whether an inputted number is less than number 20. ([`InputNumberValidator.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/InputNumberValidator.py))

9.  Create a Python program that checks whether an inputted word is longer than the word "thelongestwordever". ([`LongestWordValidator.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/LongestWordValidator.py))

10. You have a budget of 5,000 per weeks. Create a Python program that calculates your expenses from Monday to Sunday and check if you're still in budget. Also, display your expense and remaining budget. ([`BudgetCalculation.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/BudgetCalculation.py))

11. Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz". ([`FizzBuzz.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/FizzBuzz.py))

12. Write a Python program that accepts a word and counts the number of vowels in it. ([`VowelExtractor.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/VowelExtractor.py))

13. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50. ([`FibonacciSequence.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/FibonacciSequence.py))

14. Write a Python function that takes integers as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 6 (1 + 2 + 3). ([`IntegersToSum.py`](https://github.com/haruchanz64/Elective4PythonProgramming/blob/main/IntegersToSum.py))
