# Elective 4: Data Analytics

This repository contains all Python coding activities. Each coding question/activity has its own associated Python file.

1. Create a Python program that converts peso to dollar. (PesoToDollarConverter.py)

2. Create a Python program that gets the sum of two inputted numbers. (SumOfTwoNumbers.py)

3. You have 30 pieces of candy and you want to share them equally with 5 friends. How many pieces of candy does each friend get? (TotalCandyPerFriends.py)

4. You are painting a room that is 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. How many square feet of paint do you need if one gallon of paint covers 350 square feet? (GallonsOfPaint.py)

5. Create a Python program that accepts two strings, then displays its total characters when combined. (TotalCharacterOfCombinedStrings.py)

6. You are tasked to change all ".net" instances of an email to ".com". Start with this email: internet1@gmail.net (TopLevelDomainConverter.py)

7. Create a Python program that will accept the number of apples, oranges, and lemons (has to be an integer). Use string formatting to display this sentence: "I have n apples, n orangles, and n lemons." (FruitStringFormatting.py)

8. Create a Python program that checks whether an inputted number is less than number 20. (InputNumberValidator.py)

10. You have a budget of 5,000 per weeks. Create a Python program that calculates your expenses from Monday to Sunday and check if you're still in budget. Also, display your expense and remaining budget. (BudgetCalculation.py)

11. Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz". (FizzBuzz.py)

12. Write a Python program that accepts a word and counts the number of vowels in it. (VowelExtractor.py)

13. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50. (FibonacciSequence.py)

14. Write a Python function that takes integers as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 6 (1 + 2 + 3). (IntegersToSum.py)
